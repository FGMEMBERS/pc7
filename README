FligthGear's Pilatus PC-7
----------------------------------------

***
This was the Readme File for Pilatus PC-9M v1.0
But after this release the PC-9M was developed separately.
Therefore any reference to the PC-9M has been removed.
Everything else was kept in place.

Thank you for downloading Pilatus PC-9 package, this is my first release for FlightGear.

The Pilatus PC-7 is a single-engine, low-wing tandem-seat turboprop training
aircraft manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland. More info at
www.pilatus-aircraft.com

There are more variations: PC-9, PC-7 Mk II, PC-9/A, and T-6.

Big thanks to David Culp and Erik Hofman, this  model continues their work. I also want to thank XSaint for his tutorials and specially Johan G, SkyWlf77 and redneck for testing and helping me to fix some errors.
