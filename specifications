Remarks (Bemerkungen)
The PC-7 is based on the piston-powered P-3. A modified testbed flew as early as April 1966, but after a crash the programme was shelved. In 1973 another P-3 was obtained from the Swiss air force for modification, flying for the first time on 12 May 1975. Further extensive modifications followed, including a new, one-piece wing with integral tanks, altered tail and fin, bubble canopy etc.
The first production aircraft was flown on 18 August 1978. Swiss civil certification followed on 5 December that year, and deliveries started immediately. Well over one million hours flown now by PC-7s worldwide.
